Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

Key features of Go include:
- Static typing and compilation
- Garbage collection
- Built-in concurrency support
- Simple and clean syntax
- Fast compilation times
- Cross-platform compilation
- Rich standard library

Go is particularly well-suited for:
- Web services and APIs
- Cloud computing applications
- System programming
- Network programming
- Concurrent programming
